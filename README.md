Make a board using tiles from the menu below.

Set the max number of moves to consider with the input box.

"Solve" gives a plot and list of the moves in i,j coordinates.
"Clear" clears the results plot, but leaves the puzzle.
"Reset" is just like hitting F5.

Alternating color mode is detected automatically by the presence of only green/red tiles.
